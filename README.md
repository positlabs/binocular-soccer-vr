## Controls

Tapping on the screen will enter fullscreen mode. Tapping will also show app controls for a few seconds.

Zoom: How far to zoom in.

IPD: Offset one "eye" to fix double images. (May only be needed for large phones)

## Notes
- Won't work on iOS due to lack of support for [`getUserMedia`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream)
